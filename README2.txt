I included a description of my analysis in the R scropt submitted.

1. I run the package dplyr - It was best to use this package
2. I read and viewed the data tables and labels
3. I then assinged colmun names to the dataframes
4. Then I merged the datasets
5. I extracted the  mean and standard deviation data
6. Calculated averages per instructios and saved the file.
