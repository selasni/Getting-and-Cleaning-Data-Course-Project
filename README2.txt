I included a description of my analysis in the R scrpt submitted.
This page summarizes the steps I took.

1. I run the package dplyr - It was best to use this package
2. I read and viewed the various data tables and labels
-test
-train
-subject test
-activity labels
-features
3. I then assinged colmun names to the dataframes using..
-activity labels
-features
4. Then I merged the datasets
5. I extracted the  mean and standard deviation data
6. Calculated averages per instructios and saved the file.
