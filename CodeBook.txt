##Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
##This CodeBook describes variables for this project. Most of the info are derived from the feature info file.

subject_test - Test set - subject 
X_test - Test set - triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration 
y_test - Test set - triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope 

subject_train - Training set - subject
X_train - Training set - triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration 
y_train - Training set - triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope

activity_labels - Activity labels

X_all - All triaxial acceleration values
y_all - All triaxial angular velocity values
subject_all - All subjects
AllinOne - Merged all datasets - subjects, training, and the test sets 

DataWithNames -Dataframe with column titles
tidydata - Tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
